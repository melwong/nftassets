WPImager is an image editor you can use to create visual content for your blog.

A notable feature of WPImager is the ability it gives to users to share canvas. Share your canvas by simply exporting it to a zip file and passing it to others. 

We have prepared a sample canvas to share with you. 

Goto [https://wpimager.com/sample-canvas/](https://wpimager.com/sample-canvas/) and download the canvas and import it to WPImager installed on your WordPress blog.

Note the rocket in the sample, made by drawing a combination of custom shapes. 


** Coming soon **

*An add-on to turn the images in the editor into sliders.
*An add-on to combine the images into GIF files.
